# Crossing Game 🐢  
Dodge the Traffic and Level Up

## 🌍 Overview  
Crossing Game is a simple arcade-style game built with Python’s `turtle` module.  
You control a small turtle trying to cross the screen while colorful “cars” move horizontally. Each successful crossing increases your score and level, and with every level the game becomes faster and more challenging. If the turtle collides with a car, it’s **Game Over** and you can try again.

## 🚀 Features

- **Player-Controlled Turtle**
  - Move the turtle using the **arrow keys** (up, down, left, right).
  - Start at the bottom and try to reach the top safely.

- **Moving Obstacles**
  - Rows of rectangular cars move across the screen.
  - Speed and difficulty increase as your level goes up.

- **Scoring & Levels**
  - Score increases as you survive and complete crossings.
  - Level indicator shows the current difficulty level.
  - When the turtle is hit, a **Game Over** message appears.
