# PythonFunnyProjects 🎉  
A Collection of Fun Python Mini-Apps

## 🌍 Overview  
**PythonFunnyProjects** is a collection of small, playful Python projects built mainly for learning, experimentation, and fun.  
Each project lives in its own folder with its own `README.md`, code, and assets.

This repo is a great place to explore beginner–intermediate Python concepts through quirky little apps.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1️⃣ Crossing Game 🐢  
**Folder:** `Crossing-Game-Turtle-Dodge/`  
**Crossing Game** is a simple arcade-style game built with Python’s `turtle` module.  
You control a small turtle trying to cross the screen while colorful “cars” move horizontally. Each successful crossing increases your score and level, and with every level the game becomes faster and more challenging. If the turtle collides with a car, it’s **Game Over** and you can try again.

### 2️⃣ FlashyWords 🇫🇷📚
**Folder:** `FlashyWords-French-Flashcard-Trainer/` 
**FlashyWords** is a small desktop flashcard app built with Python and Tkinter.
It helps you practice French vocabulary: a French word appears on a card, then flips to show the English meaning. You decide whether you knew the word or not, and the words you answer correctly are saved so you can review them later.

### 3️⃣ LockIt 🔐
**Folder:** `LockIt-Simple-Password-Data-Manager/`  
**LockIt** is a lightweight desktop app built with Python and Tkinter that lets you store and look up information such as website logins, app accounts, or any other key–value data.

Instead of being limited to fixed fields (like just website/email/password), LockIt lets you:

- Choose a **main entry name** such as `github`, `facebook`, `bank`, `work-email`
- Add as many **subfields** (key/value pairs) as you want such as `Email`, `Username`, `Password`, `Note`
- Save everything into a local `data.json` file
- Search by the main entry name and see all stored subfields in a popup

### 4️⃣ Pomodoro ⏱️ – Focus Timer  
**Folder:** `PomodoroTimer/`  
A colorful desktop Pomodoro timer built with Tkinter and Pygame.  
Features work/break cycles, start–pause–resume controls, an alarm sound, and visual checkmarks with total time worked.

### 5️⃣ Ping Pong Game 🏓
**Folder:** `Pong-Game-2-Player-Classic/`  
This project is a classic Pong game implemented in Python.
Two players control paddles on the left and right sides of the screen, trying to bounce the ball past their opponent. The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.

### 6️⃣ Quizzer True/False ✅❌
**Folder:** `Quizzer-True-False-Quiz-App/`  
Quizzer is a small desktop quiz application built with Python and Tkinter.
It asks a series of true/false questions, updates your score as you answer, and shows a final message when you’ve completed the quiz.

### 7️⃣ Simple Calculator App 📟
**Folder:** `Simple-Flask-Calculator/`  
This is a simple web application built using Flask that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.

### 8️⃣ Snake Classic Game 🐍
**Folder:** `Snake-Game-Classic-Python-Snake/`  
This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Python.
You control a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat blue food dots. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer and your score increases. If the snake hits a wall (or itself), the game resets and the score returns to 0. The highest score is saved in a text file so you can try to beat your personal best.
